After 3 years of hard work from the team (software, hardware, artists media,
mechanical design, financial..), the F Home Studio product is selling.

It's the most impressive product I've been working on so far, designed from
the ground up, from hardware to software, to be a professional-musician
oriented tool: high quality sound and zero recording latency.

This product software is built with C / C++, VHDL, Qt and Embedded Linux.
I had to write a few drivers: for the screen, for FPGA access, and the
secondary DSP that drives the real time audio processing. It's awesome to
see it all working together, and how musicians like it.
